## Overview

**Project Title**: Justin & Jamie

**Project Description**:

Racing platformer where game doesn't stop moving; platforms generate randomly; up to 3 players

**Project Goals**:

- Create moving platforms
- Physics engine for collisions
- Allow multiplayer - arrow keys, WASD, IJKL
- 5? lives per player - die if offscreen

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure libraries are installed correctly.
2. Run and play!

Instructions for using the software:

1. Choose # of players. Beware, the game will start immediately.
2. P to pause/resume, Q to quit, R to restart
3. Each player has 5 lives, shown in the top left corner.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- I'm using Python 3.10.1
- Import `arcade` and `random` libraries

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

- [Python Arcade 2.6.17](api.arcade.academy) - docs and tutorials
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/) - super helpful tutorial
- Of course, [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) for code questions
- ChatGPT and Github Copilot for AI help

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] Fix dead players able to speed up game by moving right
- [ ] Add enemies; some move, some shoot, some explode; different damage levels
- [ ] Initial game speed up (so it'll start out slower)
- [ ] Speed scales with distance traveled
- [ ] Game over screen
- [ ] Save the princess - be the first to reach her
- [ ] Versus, co-op
- [ ] Endless, campaign/story
- [ ] Create my own sprites
- [ ] Powerups
- [ ] Invincibility on respawn
